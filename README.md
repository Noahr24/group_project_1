    <h3>Overview of project:</h3>

    <h3>Challenges & Lessons Learned</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We experienced several obstacles during different Github push/pull/merge instances.
            <br>
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>
                    We realized that coordinating on a firm schedule
                    for when to both push to main & pull as a team could eliminate some complications.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    We also became more savvy with troubleshooting Github errors in general, and were able
                    to overcome some issues by running<br>local manual merges.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <li>Utilizing Bootstrap Flex Box more in general was a learning experience for our group.</li>
